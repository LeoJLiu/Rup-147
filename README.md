Monte Carlo (Result 1).py gives: 1. the number of light curves which pass the recovery test
                                 2. the number of light curves which have a unique peak
                                 3. the number of light curves which both have a unique peak and pass the recovery test
                                 
Monte Carlo (Result 2).py gives: two figures similar to Figure 10. and Figure 11. in the pleiades paper
